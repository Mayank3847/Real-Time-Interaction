Option 2: Real-Time Interaction Module
A real-time web application that allows an admin (host) to create live polls, share session codes, and view audience responses in real time using visual charts.

**Project Description**
This module simulates a live interaction platform between a host (admin) and multiple audience members (users). The admin can create a poll, and participants can join the session via a unique code to cast their votes. The admin and users can see live-updated poll results using charts.

** Core Features **
 1. Admin Poll Creation
Admin fills in a form to create a poll.

A unique session code is generated for each poll.

Admin receives the session code to share with users.

 2. User Participation
Users join the poll using the session code.

Each user selects and submits a vote from available options.

 3. Real-Time Updates
Vote results are updated live for all participants.

Data is reflected instantly via a bar chart or pie chart.

 4. Live Results Visualization
Results are displayed using Chart.js as either bar or pie charts.

Total votes and per-option counts are visible.

 5. (Optional) Session History
Admin can view history of past polls (limited to recent 10).

Each historical entry shows question, options, and vote stats.

 6. (Optional) Countdown Timer
Admin can trigger a countdown timer (e.g., 5 minutes) to auto-close voting (not implemented by default but can be added).

 ** Technologies Used **
* Frontend (Client)
React.js — Component-based UI

React Router — Page navigation

Context API — Global state for poll data and socket

Socket.IO Client — Real-time communication

Axios — HTTP requests

Chart.js + react-chartjs-2 — Visualization for live poll results

* Backend (Server)
Node.js — Runtime environment

Express.js — REST API handling

Socket.IO — Real-time bidirectional communication

Mongoose — MongoDB object modeling

MongoDB — NoSQL database to store poll data

** Directory Structure Overview **
* Backend
/models/Poll.js — Poll schema (question, options, votes, session code)

/controllers/pollController.js — Logic for poll creation, retrieval

/routes/pollRoutes.js — API route definitions

/services/socketService.js — Socket.io logic for vote and session join

server.js — Entry point and server configuration

.env — MongoDB URI, server port, frontend CORS config

* Frontend
/context/PollContext.jsx — Global state and socket manager

/pages/AdminPage.jsx — Admin poll creation & result display

/pages/UserPage.jsx — User vote interface

/components/admin/CreatePoll.jsx — Poll creation form

/components/user/JoinSession.jsx — User session join form

/components/common/ChartDisplay.jsx — Chart.js bar/pie display

/services/api.js — Axios API methods

/services/socket.js — Initializes socket client

.env — API and socket server URL config

** How It Works (Flow) **
Admin Flow:

Visits /admin

Fills out question and options

Submits poll → gets session code

Shares session code with audience

Views real-time bar chart of responses

User Flow:

Visits home page /

Enters session code

Sees poll question and options

Casts a vote → result updates live

Real-Time Sync:

Each new vote triggers a submitVote socket event

Backend updates the database and broadcasts results via updateResults

All connected clients receive and render new data

* Setup Instructions
* Prerequisites
Node.js and npm

MongoDB (local or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

** Installation **
Backend:

cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in /backend:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/realtimepoll
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
Start backend server:


npm start
Frontend:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Create a .env file in /frontend:


REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
Start frontend dev server:


npm start
** Summary **
This Real-Time Interaction Module is an effective solution for engaging audience participation through live polling. It demonstrates full-stack development using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSockets, with optional advanced features like session history and timers.
